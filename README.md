# Python Flask-Api

## Story
Our school asked me to develop a survey program "we want you to develop a survey program for our school, so that teachers and administrators in our school can create surveys whenever they want, and only people in the specified category can participate in this survey, and we can also see the survey results and download a survey as a pdf whenever we want" I wrote an api that visualizes the data from the survey with python.



## Purpose
Counting and visualizing the answers to the questions in the questionnaire and creating





## Working Logic and Flowchart
The website sends a predetermined JSON structure to an API using JavaScript. The API processes the received data, creates visualizations based on the data, converts the generated visualizations to base64 format, and then sends them back to the website.
